Day 1:

1. Introduction to Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma: This session will provide an overview of Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma methodologies, their benefits, and how they are related to 7 QC tools and 5S.

2. The Seven Quality Control Tools: Participants will learn about the following tools and how to use them to improve quality:

a) Cause and Effect Diagram (Fishbone Diagram): This tool helps identify the root causes of a problem by breaking it down into categories.

b) Pareto Chart: This tool helps prioritize problems based on their frequency or impact using the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).

c) Control Chart: This tool helps monitor a process over time to identify trends, patterns, and special causes of variation.

d) Check Sheet: This tool helps collect data systematically and identify patterns or trends.

e) Scatter Diagram: This tool helps identify the relationship between two variables to determine if they are related or not.

f) Stratification: This tool helps group data based on certain criteria to identify patterns or trends.

g) Histogram: This tool helps visualize data distribution to identify areas of high or low variability.

3. Case Studies: Participants will work in groups to apply the Seven Quality Control Tools to real-world scenarios. They will also discuss how these tools can be used in their own organizations.

Day 2:

1. Introduction to 5S: Participants will learn about the following principles of 5S and how they can be applied in their organization:

a) Sort (Seiri): Remove unnecessary items from the workspace.

b) Set in Order (Seiton): Arrange items in a logical order for easy access and use.

c) Shine (Seiso): Clean the workspace regularly to prevent dirt and dust accumulation.

d) Standardize (Seiketsu): Establish standard procedures for all tasks to ensure consistency and efficiency.

e) Sustain (Shitsuke): Maintain the 5S principles through continuous improvement efforts.

2. Case Studies: Participants will work in groups to apply the 5S principles to their own organizationâ€™s workspace or process. They will also discuss how these principles can be integrated into their overall quality management system.

3. Conclusion: Participants will summarize what they have learned during the course, discuss any challenges they may face in implementing these tools and principles in their organization, and develop an action plan for applying them in their workplace.

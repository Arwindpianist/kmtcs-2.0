2. Click on **"Start now"** or **"Sign up"**.
3. Fill in your email address, full name, and create a password.
4. Click **"Create account"**.
5. Verify your email by clicking the link sent to your inbox.

### **Step 2: Complete the Business Account Setup**
1. Log in to your Stripe account.
2. You’ll be prompted to complete your profile with details like:
   - **Business type** (e.g., sole proprietor, company).
   - **Personal details** (name, address, phone).
   - **Bank account details** for payouts.

### **Step 3: Turn On Test Mode**
1. After logging in, you'll be taken to the **Dashboard**.
2. Locate the **"Test Mode"** toggle in the top-right corner and switch it on. It should now display **"Viewing test data"**.

### **Step 4: Retrieve API Keys**
1. In the Dashboard, go to **Developers** in the left menu.
2. Click **API keys** under Developers.
3. Copy the **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_...`).
4. Click **Reveal test key secret**, and copy the **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_...`).
5. Save these keys securely and send them to me.

### **Important Notes**
- Make sure to keep the secret key private and share it only with trusted developers.
- These test keys are only for testing purposes. You’ll need to retrieve live keys when you’re ready to go live.
